Quarter is an e-commerce like web application where
properities are sold and users can
send request and comment for a property.
My main aim was to test my backend skills for the first time after [Pustok](https://github.com/TAHiRLI/22.-Task-21-12-22-Pustok-14.0) application. Check my next Project [Medlab](https://github.com/TAHiRLI/FinalProject).
